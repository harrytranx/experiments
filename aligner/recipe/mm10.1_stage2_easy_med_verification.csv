According to Eq. 4.1, we display the deficit of \(R_{\gamma\gamma}(h^{0})\) in the left panel of Fig. 5 as a function of \(H^{\pm}\) mass for various values of \(\lambda_{a}\) and with \(m_{H^{0}}\geq 140\) GeV. As it can be seen, a mass about \(255\) GeV and above is allowed for \(H^{\pm}\) within \(+1\sigma\) of ATLAS value for \(\lambda_{a}=-1.4\). Once \(\lambda_{a}\) increases, this lower bound decreases consistently to reach its lowest value around \(\sim\,197\) GeV, given \(\lambda_{a}>-0.5\). This situation is exactly the opposite for CMS, where only the range \(200\leq m_{H^{\pm}}\leq 250\) (GeV) is excluded for \(\lambda_{a}=1.4\). Besides, \(R_{\gamma\gamma}(h^{0})\) tends towards its standard value for \(\lambda_{a}\neq 0\), and to 1 for large \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) whatever the variation of \(\lambda_{a}\).

In this scenario, the anti-correlation between \(R_{\gamma\gamma}(h^{0})\) and \(R_{\gamma\,Z}(h^{0})\) is displayed in the left panel of Fig. 5, taking into account the experimental data at \(1\sigma\). At first sight, the \(R_{\gamma\,Z}(h^{0})\) deviation is almost nul relatively to its standard value, and contrary to what has been claimed in [13], \(R_{\gamma\gamma}(h^{0})\) and \(R_{\gamma\,Z}(h^{0})\) are always anti-correlated, independently of \(\lambda_{a}\) sign.

13337,True,True,,,,,"additional features related to learning context, interaction times and hint usage provided by the ASSISTment 2009 [Feng et al. (2009)] and Junyi15 [Chang et al. (2015)] datasets. While that work employs most information contained in the Junyi15 dataset, it fails to utilize the prerequisite structure among topics in the curriculum, and does not evaluate the potential benefit of those features for logistic regression models. EKT [Liu et al. (2019)] uses the question text to learn exercise embeddings which are then used for downstream performance predictions. MVKM [Zhao et al. (2020)] uses a multi-view tensor factorization to model knowledge acquisition from different types of learning materials (quizzes, videos, ...). SAINT+ [Shin et al. (2021)] and MUSE [Zhang et al. (2021)] augment transformer models with interaction time features to capture short-term memorization and forgetting. Closest to the spirit of this manuscript is an early work by Feng2009:Addressing. That work integrates features related to accuracy, response time, attempt-usage and help-seeking behavior into a logistic regression model to enhance exam score predictions. However, their exam score prediction problem is inherently different from our problem of continuous performance modeling because it focuses only on the final learning outcome and does not capture user proficiency on the question and KC level. Unlike our work Feng2009:Addressing, do not evaluate features related to lecture video and reading material consumption, prerequisite structure and learning context. Their study is also limited to two small-scale datasets (\(<1000\) students) collected by the ASSISTment system.

This paper offers the first systematic study of a wide variety of features extracted from alternative types of log data. It analyzes four recent large-scale datasets which capture the learning process at different levels of granularity and focus on various aspects of student behaviour. Our study identifies a set of features which can improve the accuracy of knowledge tracing techniques and we give recommendations regarding which types of user interactions should be captured in log data of future tutoring systems. Further, our feature evaluation led us to novel logistic regression models achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on all four datasets.

## 3 Datasets



In recent years multiple education companies released large-scale ITS datasets to promote research on novel knowledge assessment techniques. Compared to earlier sizable datasets such as Bridge to Algebra 2006 [Stamper et al. (2010)] and ASSISTment 2012 [Feng et al. (2009)] these new datasets capture an order of magnitude more student responses making them attractive for data intensive modeling approaches. Table 2 provides an overview of the four recent large-scale student log datasets, from different ITS systems, we use in this paper. Taken together, these datasets capture over 197 million lines of log data from over 789,000 students, including correct/incorrect responses to over 87 million questions. While each ITS collects the conventional timestamp for each question (item) presented to the student, the correctness of their answer, and knowledge component (KC) attributes associated with the question, they also contain additional interaction data. Going beyond pure question-solving activities multiple datasets provide information about how and when students utilize reading materials, lecture videos and hints. In addition there are various types of meta-information about the individual students (e.g. age, gender, ...) as well as the current learning context (e.g. school, topic number, ...). All four tutoring systems exhibit a modular structure in which learning activities are assigned to distinct categories (e.g. pre-test, effective learning, review, ...). Further, three of the datasets provide meta-information indicating which questions, videos, etc. are related to which KCs.

Figure 2 visualizes the distribution of the number of responses per student for each dataset (i.e.",png,/fsx_1/datasets_30days/datarecipe_source/sg_mmllm_stage2_compliant_cap_qa_exp28_kosher_v2/20240827v4/arxiv_pages_large

Identify the solution to the question posed in the table. Lauren Keyana Keke Palmer (born August 26, 1993) is an American actress, singer, songwriter, dancer and television personality. Palmer was born in Harvey, Illinois, and raised in Robbins, Illinois. She released her debut album, So Uncool, on September 18, 2007, through Atlantic Records. The album failed to chart on the US Billboard 200 but did chart at number 85 on the R&B chart. The album was preceded by the second single Keep It Movin'. Palmer made her acting debut in the 2004 film Barbershop 2: Back in Business and rose to prominence in 2006 for her breakthrough role in Akeelah and the Bee as well as starring in Madea's Family Reunion. Palmer has also starred in films such as The Longshots (2008), Shrink (2009) and Animal (2014). In 2012, Palmer starred in four films: Joyful Noise, Winx Club: The Secret of the Lost Kingdom, Ice Age: Continental Drift, and Virgin Mary. Besides films, Palmer has also starred in the television films Knights of the South Bronx (2005), Jump In! (2007), and Rags (2012), among others.
